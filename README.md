# Flight-Sim-Project

TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE GAME AND HOW THE SCRIPTS VARIABLES WORK. 
***We will be updating this regularly.***

Starting with the Assets folder:
  Materials - these are just the basic materials used for the planes, buildings and ground.
  
  Prefabs - this folder splits into both the PaperPlanes & Target Indicators folder. The Target Indicators here are used for the World Empty Object to see enemy/ally planes.(These go on the UI Controller scripts for "Target Indicator Prefab".)
  
  Scenes - these are the two scenes for this project file. Once again, I just like to keep my testing files separate from the actual game just to keep things less cluttered and organized. It's also easier on my CPU and allows me to have ONLY what I need in the actually game at all times so I don't get confused lol. Don't worry, I'm working on putting the actual full game file on GitHub as well.
  
  Scripts - this folder splits into the AI Scripts, Collision Avoid(Incomplete), & UI Controller Scripts folders.
    >AI Scripts: theses scripts are the current AI scripts at the moment.(They go on the different paper plane prefabs.)
